# Building
1. `cd` into this directory
2. `make`

# Run
After building you can run `./driver`

# Clean Build
`make clean`

# ToDO
Add implemention to `list.h` and `list.cpp` to get `./driver` to work and print out
the expected values. You should implement a [Doubly Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list). You are not to modify any of the existing signatures in the classes without asking first. Feel free to add any additional functions, methods, members, or classes that you like.
